  Test React Components with Jest and React Testing Library
</h1>

This repo is derived from ðŸ’¯ [Kent.C.Dodds' react-testing-library-course](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library-course).

It is re-organized with relative reading materials and more complex real world examples based on my experience and thoughts about using react-testing-library.

## Preparation

Make sure you have node >= 10 & yarn >= 1.19.1 installed, and run `yarn`.

Run `yarn test` to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Course schedule

### Understand what problems these tools are solving

1.  `react-dom.js` - Render a React component for testing

2.  `jest-dom.js` - Use jest-dom for improved assertions

3.  `dom-testing-library.js` - Use dom-testing-library to write more
    maintainable React tests

4.  `react-testing-library.js` - Use react-testing-library to render and test
    React Components

### Readings
